but
think
everyone
needs
know
how
live
alone
because
our
life
circumstances
often
force
people
live
alone
example
many
high
school
college
graduates
move
away
their
hometowns
continue
their
education
take
jobs
also
married
people
might
feel
they
will

currently

also
suffered
humiliation
subjugation
rise
china
its
rejuvenation
dreams
chinese
people
many

what
connotations
china
peaceful

let
me
make
following
points
firstly
promoting
china
peaceful
rise
must
take
full
advantage
very
good
opportunity
world
peace
endeavor
develop
strengthen
ourselves
same
time
safeguard

peace
our

secondly
rise
china
only
based
our
own
strength
our
independent
self
reliant
hard
efforts
also
based
broad
market
china
abundant
human
resources
capital
reserves
well
innovation
our

result
reform
thirdly
china
rise
could
achieved
without
rest
world
must
always
maintain
opening
up
policy
develop
economic
trade
exchanges
friendly
countries
basis
equality
mutual
benefit
fourthly
china
rise
will
require
long
period
time
probably
hard
work
many
generations
chinese
people
fifthly
rise
china
will
stand
way
any
other
country
pose
threat
any
other
country
achieved
expense
any
particular
nation
china
does
seek

now
nor
will
ever
seek

even
after

much
do
who
was

googled
him
there
wasn

captain
named
leonard
generson
but
did
find
dr
richard
generson
oral
surgeon
living
new
jersey
since
generson
common
name
decided
write
him
dr
generson
was
kind
enough
write
back
he
told
me
his
father
leonard
richard

was
born
he
lived
new

city
but
went
medical
school

though
he
told
me
there
were
always
lot
novels
house
his
mother
probably
cleaned
house
after
his
father
death
same
year
my
husband
bought
set
used
book
store
found
letter
very
moving
its
brief
portrait
intelligent
brave
man
his
life
service
same
time
made
me
question
my
presumption
somehow
generson
were
connected
because
owned

set
books
letter
both
told
me
little
about
him
told
me
would
never
really
know
anything
about
him
why
should
his
son
must
been
startled
hear
stranger
such
fragile
pretext
what
had

will
think
him

people
many
generations
what
connotations
china
peaceful
rise
let
me
make
following
points
firstly
promoting
china
peaceful
rise
must
take
full
advantage
very
good
opportunity
world
peace
endeavor
develop
strengthen
ourselves
same
time
safeguard
world
peace
our
own
development
secondly
rise
china
only
based
our
own
strength
our
independent
self
reliant
hard
efforts
also
based
broad
market
china
abundant
human
resources
capital
reserves
well
innovation
our
systems
result
reform
catti
thirdly
china
rise
could
achieved
without
rest
world
must
always
maintain
opening
up
policy
develop
economic
trade
exchanges
friendly
countries
basis
equality
mutual
benefit
fourthly
china
rise
will
require
long
period
time
probably
hard
work
many
generations
chinese
people
fifthly
rise
china
will
stand
way
any
other
country
pose
threat
any
other
country
achieved
expense
any
particular
nation
china
does
seek
hegemony
now
nor
will
ever
seek
hegemony
even
after
china
becomes
more
powerful
very
mention
asean
leads
me
back
asean
summit
meeting
last
year
when
mr
mahathir
mr
goh
chok
tong
compared
china

elephant
they
argued
china
rise
won
pose
any
threat
anyone
china
witnessed
both
glorious
moments
humiliating
episodes
its
history
over
years
rise
china
been
dream
cherished
many
generations
chinese
nation
what
china
peaceful
rise
about
catti
first
means
must
seize
upon
exciting
opportunity
prevailing
peaceful
international
environment
offers
us
boost
our
own
development
way
safeguarding
world
peace
return
second
must
rely
largely
our
own
push
china
rise
means
must
make
full
use
our
vast
market
abundant
labor
force
large
capital
reserve
embrace
reform
driven
institutional
innovation
third
china
rise
isolation
rest
world
china
must
remain
open
committed
business
interactions
countries
good
will
basis
equality
mutual
benefit
fourth
will
take
years
decades
even
generations
before
china
truly
rises
global
power
fifth
china
rise
won
get
way
others
threaten
anyone
happen
sacrifice
anybody
else
china
doesn
will
never
seek
hegemony
even
after
becomes
